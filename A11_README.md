#A11 - SAT

SAT collision is in Collider.cpp, within Collider::IsColliding. OBBs are generated in Collider::CreateOBB.
Collision is heavily based on Morgan Kaufman. Move the ball with the arrow keys, bounding boxes turn red when they are colliding with something.
Press spacebar to use the flipper.

Basic implementation was done by Sam, with additional help with math from Greg + Tom.
